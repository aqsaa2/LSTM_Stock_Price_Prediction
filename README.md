# Stock Price Prediction Web Application

## üìö Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application for stock price prediction using a deep learning model (`LSTM`). The app integrates with **Yahoo Finance** to fetch historical stock data, trains an LSTM model (built and trained in a Colab notebook and saved as `stock_dl_model.h5`), and visualizes predicted prices along with Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The web interface is built using Flask.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Price-Prediction-WebApp.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction-WebApp
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:


 ```bash
cd <project_directory>
 ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

Running the Application

Run the Flask application:

```bash

python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the web application.


Usage

Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., OGDC.KA) in the input field and click "Predict".

The application will fetch historical data, generate predictions, and display:

Descriptive statistics of the stock data.
Visualizations of the stock's closing price with EMA trends.
Predicted vs. original stock price trends.
You can download the dataset as a CSV file by clicking the "Download Dataset" button.

Requirements

The requirements.txt file should contain the following Python packages (example):

 ```bash
Flask
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
yfinance  # Or another data source library
matplotlib
 ```
